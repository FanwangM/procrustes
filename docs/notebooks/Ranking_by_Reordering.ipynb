    "In American collegiate football, it is traditional for each team to play one game against every other team in their division. We can use two-sided permutation Procrustes to use the results to rank the teams.\n",
    "The data taken from *A. N. Langville, C. D. Meyer, Ranking by Reordering Methods, Princeton University Press, 2012, Ch. 8, pp. 97â€“112.* shows the pair-wise relationship for 5 football teams in the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference. In Table 1, each team is given zero points for a game they lost (Duke lost to every other team in its division) and the point differential is used for games the team won. (E.g., Miami beats Duke by 45 points and UNC by 18 points.) "
